        Pass the post text direct to the tool. 
    
    2. If the lenght check fails (tool result if 'fail'), provide spefici feedback on what needs to be improved.
        Use the tool message as a guideline, but add your own professional critique.

    3. If the lenght check passes, evaluate the post against this criteria:
        - REQUIRED ELEMENTS:

            5. Clear and concise writing

    ## OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
